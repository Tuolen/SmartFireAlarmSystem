# SmartFireAlarmSystem

Our innovative system utilizes a flame sensor to detect flames of varying intensities, enabling effective fire detection and response. By analyzing the flame's strength, our system adjusts the sound of a buzzer and the water pressure from a pump accordingly. Additionally, we have incorporated serial communication, which sends instant notifications to a connected phone when a fire is detected. This integrated solution ensures prompt and tailored action in the event of a fire hazard
