# SmartFireAlarmSystem

The project “Smart Fire Alarm System” was an innovative embedded system designed for precise fire detection and rapid response. Utilizing a highly sensitive flame sensor, the system accurately detects varying flame intensities. Upon detection, it triggers a loud alarm through a buzzer, ensuring immediate alerting in case of fire hazards. Additionally, the system activates a water pump for fire suppression. Real-time notifications are sent to connected devices such as Mobile phones via serial communication, while a clear message indicating "A fire is detected" is displayed on an LED screen. The device offers multi-layered protection, combining visual, auditory, and remote alerts for comprehensive fire prevention. integrating cutting-edge technologies to enhance safety measures and provide timely warnings.
